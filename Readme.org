* Introduction
**xmenu** is a context menu designed for Xorg. It's intended to be a lightweight and versatile menu system that can work with any window manager.

* Dynamic Theming with wal
One of the standout features of xmenu is its dynamic theming. The menu automatically adapts its colors from the cached colors of `wal`. This ensures a consistent look across your system if you're already using `wal` for theming.

* Installation
First, clone the repository and navigate to its directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone <Your Repository URL>
cd xmenu
#+END_SRC

Next, setup by copying the included `xmenu` directory to your `~/.config`:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cp -r .config/xmenu ~/.config/
#+END_SRC

* Overview
- **main.c**: The core that detects right-clicks and invokes `menu.py`. It's lightweight and doesn't rely on GTK.
- **menu.py**: Python script for displaying the context menu.
- **conf**: Configuration file.
